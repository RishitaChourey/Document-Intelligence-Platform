# Document Intelligence Platform

## Overview

The **Document Intelligence Platform** is a modern web application built for intelligent document processing and analysis. Its primary function is to provide a clean, powerful user interface for uploading, categorizing, and interacting with large volumes of unstructured documents, such as PDFs.

The application leverages a robust **Next.js** frontend to deliver a smooth, responsive experience, designed to work seamlessly with a powerful, separate API backend responsible for the core document intelligence logic (OCR, summarization, etc.).
